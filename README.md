# HTML Jump Starter

Just wanted to try out HTMX and Tailwind CSS.

This is a simple tryout of some dynamic pages without client side javascript.
All the server side javascript has been used with NodeJS and Express.
Since I used the simple functionality, there is no `.env` in this.

## How to run

Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Start the server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

### All pages

-   [Home](http://localhost:3000/)
-   [Temperature](http://localhost:3000/temperature)
-   [Polling](http://localhost:3000/polling)
-   [Search](http://localhost:3000/search)

## How to use

Just click on the buttons and see the magic happen.
